You can become a member 
if you are a non-profit 
who do something good for 
the world.

Web page is funded by a 
service directory, listing
everything from Accounting
to Zulu dance performers.

Anyone who introduces a
paying customer, is listed
with the customer as their
agent. Agents get 50% of
all their customer's
contributions as commision.

If agent A introduces 
agent B to the scheme,
then agent A is listed as
the sponsor of agent B.
Agent B also gets 50% of 
all their own customer's
contributions as all agents
do. Agent A gets 10% of 
the contributions of all
their sponsored agents.

When agent B introduces 
agent C, the same applies.
Agent A does not get any
portion of the income of 
agent C, but B gets 10% 
of C's contributions.
