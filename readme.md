Web page is funded by a 
service directory, listing
everything from Accounting
to Zulu dance performers.

Anyone who introduces a
paying customer, is listed
with the customer as their
agent. Agents get 50% of
all their customers'
contributions as commision.

If agent A introduces 
agent B to the scheme,
then agent A is listed as
the sponsor of agent B.
Agent B also gets 50% of 
all their own customers'
contributions as all agents
do. Agent A gets 10% of 
the contributions of all
their sponsored agents.

When agent B introduces 
agent C, the same applies.
Agent A does not get any
portion of the income of 
agent C, but B gets 10% 
of C's contributions.

Once a client stops 
paying their listing fee,
their listing is suspended
and if they start paying
again within 6 months,
their agent stays the same.

After 6 months, a client
must sign up again as a new
client, and the introducing
agent will be listed as
their sponsor.

Clients who pay their listing
fees for 5 years without 
missing more than 6 months,
get a permanent 50% 
discount from the start of
year 6. This reduces their
contributions and their
agent payouts which remains
at 50% of their clients'
contributions and 10% of 
sponsored agents clients'
contributions.

Listing fees will be 
revised yearly on 1 January.
